## Objective

R package that finds efficient designs for choice experiments with mixtures. It uses a coordinate-exchange algorithm and allows the computation of locally D-optimal, Bayesian D-optimal, locally I-optimal, and Bayesian I-optimal designs for first-order, second-order, and special-cubic Scheff√© models.

Work in progress. Further instructions and details will be added to this README in the near future.
